1) There are 180 observations of 81 variables.
2) the variable starting with t pertain to time.
3) the variables starting with f pertain to frequency.
4) The dataset was manually downloaded to local computerbefore the tidaying process started. This compromisies reporduciblility but thatwas not the goal of this excercise.
5) THe datawas read in using read.table
6) using dimesnion analysis the datsets were merged from the training / testing /subject and activitiees file.
7)greply was used to identify the mean and std, so that onlythese cols wouldbe extracted.
8)Further clean-up has been explained in the readme file.
